# Graduate Application Review System (GARS)

A system for managing applications to the Stony Brook CS graduate school. Users are the application reviwers. GARS maintains data privacy and fairly assigns applications to reviewers.

It has been tested on a LAMP stack (using Xubuntu specifically). To deploy, edit config.php and serve the application at `BASE_URL`.
